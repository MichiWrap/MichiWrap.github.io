			<p class="subtitle"><br>About the Artist</p>
			<p class="bodytext">Anita graduated from Drew University, Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor's in Art and Computer Science. Four moths after her graduation, she found herself interning at her current job, Dreamkind. Within another 4 months, she was hired, and within a year she rose to the lead 2d artist position. Anita is highly ambitious and willing to experiment with new styles and techniques in the digital medium. Though she is most comfortable working in an eerie, toon style, she doesn't limit herself to just that.  </p>
			<p class="subtitle"><br>Artist Statement</p>
			<p class="bodytext">There is something magical that happens when graphite hits a sheet of paper. Your hand loosens as your mind projects whatever it can channel and before long an essence is born. For me, the outcome is more or less the same. Whenever pen touches paper a character is born. The more I draw this character, the more I learn about them. They tell me what they like, what they fear, where they are from, and where they are heading. Through drawings, sketches, and studies, the character reveals everything to me. <br/></p> 
			<p class="bodytext">In my art, I translate these character concepts into digital media in hopes of bringing them to life. Through comic panels and animations I can express their emotions, personalities, conflicts, and journeys in ways no other media would allow. By creating narratives I am able to showcase the adventures of these characters and share with everyone what they have shared with me. My art is a gateway into their lives; one in which the viewer may enter to spectate the journeys of these whacky, unnerving, and yet oddly relatable characters.<br/></p>
			<p class="bodytext">I have recently been blessed with exploring another medium in character design. This medium has been game development, and with it I can combine narrative and animation to tell these characters' tales. Through this I feel as if I can create something that fully brings a character to life. More so than still images or animation alone because I bring the viewer to a deeper relation with the character. The viewer not only becomes the player, but they also become one with the character by taking control and entering these characters' lives. I hope to be able to create more characters and interactive stories through game development.</p>
