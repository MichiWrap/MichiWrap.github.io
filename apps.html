						<span>
							<p class="title">ToyEscape</p>
							<p class="subtitle">Dreamkind</p>
							<br>
							<p class="bodytext">Toy Escape is an endless slingshot arcade game. In this project I took another leading art role where I was in charge of all the 2d art, character designs and creation, UI/UX, animation, and many particle effects.</p>

						<span>
							<p class="title">Rewind</p>
							<p class="subtitle">Dreamkind</p>
							<br>
							<p class="bodytext">Rewind is a narrative-driven experience, and it was also the first project where I took a leading art role. I was trusted as the only 2d art on this project, so all of the concept art, storyboarding, UI/UX design, 2d graphics, and even the mini game design were my responsibilities. I worked closely with our 3d artist by reviewing all cut scenes and animations. I also worked closely with our programmers to make sure effects and transitions worked properly.</p>

						<span>
							<p class="title">Alphabet Stories</p>
							<p class="subtitle">Dreamkind</p>
							<br>
							<p class="bodytext">Alphabet Stories is a preschool app that teaches kids reading and writing. Towards the end of Rewind's development, I was given the opportunity to work on Alphabet Stories as a lead role, and with that I completely revamped the look and feel of this app. I was given the same responsibilities here as I was Rewind, but since most of this game includes 2d art, I was able to put my own hand into this project more than I could with any previous ones.</p>

							<p class="title">Monster Guard</p>
							<p class="subtitle">American Red Cross</p>
							<br>
							<p class="bodytext">Monster Guard is an app made for the American Red Cross. For this project I was in charge of concept art for characters, environments, in game items, and storyboards.

							<p class="title">The Amazings</p>
							<p class="subtitle">Carolinas HealthCare Systems</p>
							<br>
							<p class="bodytext">The Amazings is a level-based runner that teaches kids about asthma. This was the first project in which I was given the opportunity to character design. Aside from the that, I also worked on the concepts for the environments, the concepts for the in-game hazards/obstacles, and the artwork within the unlockable comic pages.</p>

							<p class="bodytext">Disney Puzzle Packs is a digital puzzle book that features many lovable Disney and Pixar characters. This was the first project I was placed on when I began my work with Dreamkind. Most of the art was delivered to us by the client, but I was in charge of wireframes, placement, adjustments, and implementation. Any UI that wasn't provided were my responsibility to create.</p>
